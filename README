DuckDuck*Bang!*
==============

![](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/duckduckgobang/blob/icon/icon.png)

DuckDuck*Bang!* is an unofficial Firefox add-on that adds buttons for quickly making [!bang queries](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html).

Typing `!w` is easy on a desktop, but cumbersome on mobile devices. With DuckDuck*Bang!*, making a `!bang` query is as easy as tapping a button.

Development & Testing
-------


1. Install the Firefox addon SDK from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation

2. Deploy to desktop with `cfx run`

   Deploy to mobile with `cfx run -a fennec-on-device -b /usr/bin/adb --mobile-app firefox --force-mobile`

3. Yay!
